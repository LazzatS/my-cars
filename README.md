MyCars is an iOS app that let's you make notes for you cars, save photos and search for different car brands.

I've used a tab bar at the bottom in order to navigate between different screens.

The first screen, while empty, shows a quote first. 
But when cars are added to the list after pressing the "Add" button and entering car's title, notes/reminders as well as time for the task to be done,
the input is saved on the main screen.

The second tab allows you to upload and save pictures. By clicking "+" button you can get access to the photo Library of your mobile, select and save photos you want.

The last item shows a list of brands. You can use a search bar to find the brand you are interested in and it will show you the screen with the logo of this brand.

Finally, this app can help people, who forget that they need to update their insurance certificate or driving licence, so that besides it has a reminder in it, if you forget you documents at home, you are still able to use them when needed.
